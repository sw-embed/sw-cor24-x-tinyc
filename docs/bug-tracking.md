### BUG-001: Nested function-like macro not expanded

**Filed by:** tml24c
**Fixed:** 2026-03-23
**Component:** `tc24r-preprocess` (substitute.rs)

When an object-like `#define` references a function-like macro, the
preprocessor did not expand the inner macro. The compiler treated it
as a function call instead.

```c
#define MAKE_SYMBOL(idx) (((idx) << 2) | 2)
#define NIL_VAL MAKE_SYMBOL(0)
int x = NIL_VAL;  // generated: jal _MAKE_SYMBOL (wrong)
```

**Root cause:** `expand_ident()` pushed simple `#define` replacements
verbatim without re-expansion. The function-macro path already called
`expand_line()` recursively, but the simple define path did not.

**Fix:** Added `expand_line()` re-expansion after simple define
substitution in `substitute.rs:expand_ident()`.

### BUG-002: Compiler panic on two-level #define constant expression

**Filed by:** tml24c
**Fixed:** 2026-03-23
**Component:** `tc24r-preprocess` (substitute.rs)

When one object-like macro references another in an expression, the
compiler panics with "no entry found for key" in `tc24r-emit-load-store`.

```c
#define TAG_SYMBOL 2
#define NIL_VAL ((0 << 2) | TAG_SYMBOL)
arr[0] = NIL_VAL;  // panic: TAG_SYMBOL treated as undefined variable
```

**Root cause:** Same as BUG-001 — simple `#define` replacement was not
recursively expanded, so `TAG_SYMBOL` inside `NIL_VAL` reached the
parser as an identifier instead of being expanded to `2`.

**Fix:** Same one-line fix as BUG-001.
